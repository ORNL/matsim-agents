Rules for judging the claim:
- A failed_to_compute or not_converged record is not evidence for or against a material.
- A thermodynamic_stability claim is decided only by converged DFT stability (hull) evidence with
  complete reference phases; MLIP evidence supports at most an energy_ranking claim.
- An energy_ranking claim needs at least MLIP relaxation evidence of kind energy_ranking or
  stability.
- When admissible records disagree, the claim is unresolved.
- Evidence that does not cover the claim's stated scope cannot support a decisive verdict.
- Answer unresolved when the evidence does not decide the claim, and request DFT only when a DFT
    calculation could decide it. Select a follow-up test only when it addresses a visible evidence
    gap, and only from the provided options.

Does the evidence support, contradict, or leave the claim unresolved?

{"status":"unresolved","evidence_ids":["ev-ac49638f6133bbec20a681ad"],"request_dft":true,"proposed_test_ids":["relax-five-pilot-orderings-same-protocol"],"rationale":"The claim is relative: ordering 01 is the lowest-energy of five orderings. The only evidence is a single converged DFT static calculation for ordering 01 (-9.35081491 eV/atom, force 0.00883 eV/A, stress 0.3 kbar). It is a valid, well-relaxed number, but a ranking needs the energies of the other four orderings computed under the same protocol, and none are provided. Without them the energy above the lowest ordering cannot be evaluated against the 0.0 eV/atom threshold, so the evidence neither supports nor contradicts the claim. Caveats: the protocol signature has no convergence testing, which matters because cation-ordering energy differences are often only a few meV/atom. Also, the evidence record has no stated scope. No peers have spoken, so I have no peer claims to support or dispute yet. A falsification test is to relax all five orderings with the same VASP settings and compare energy per atom; ordering 01 is falsified if any other ordering is lower by more than the numerical noise. The proposed test is the only listed one and directly addresses this gap. A DFT calculation could decide the claim, so I request it."}
