Rules for judging the claim:
- A failed_to_compute or not_converged record is not evidence for or against a material.
- A thermodynamic_stability claim is decided only by converged DFT stability (hull) evidence with
  complete reference phases; MLIP evidence supports at most an energy_ranking claim.
- An energy_ranking claim needs at least MLIP relaxation evidence of kind energy_ranking or
  stability.
- When admissible records disagree, the claim is unresolved.
- Evidence that does not cover the claim's stated scope cannot support a decisive verdict.
- Answer unresolved when the evidence does not decide the claim, and request DFT only when a DFT
    calculation could decide it. Select a follow-up test only when it addresses a visible evidence
    gap, and only from the provided options.

Does the evidence support, contradict, or leave the claim unresolved?

{"status": "contradicted", "evidence_ids": ["ev-ce41690aa36014fdb717d1b4"], "request_dft": false, "proposed_test_ids": [], "rationale": "The hypothesis states that the archived ideal olivine LiFePO4 calculation represents antiferromagnetic (AFM) Fe ordering, which is defined by a net cell moment at or below 0.5 muB. Evidence `ev-ce41690aa36014fdb717d1b4` reports a `total_magnetization_abs` of 16.0 muB for the specified LiFePO4-olivine-ideal structure. This value significantly exceeds the 0.5 muB threshold, directly contradicting the hypothesis. Furthermore, the `magmom_initial` setting in the evidence ('Fe 5.0 muB (all parallel)') indicates that the calculation was initialized in a ferromagnetic configuration, not an antiferromagnetic one, which is consistent with the large resulting total magnetization."}
