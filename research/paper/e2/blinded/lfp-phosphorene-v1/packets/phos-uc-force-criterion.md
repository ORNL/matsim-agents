Rules for judging the claim:
- A failed_to_compute or not_converged record is not evidence for or against a material.
- A thermodynamic_stability claim is decided only by converged DFT stability (hull) evidence with
  complete reference phases; MLIP evidence supports at most an energy_ranking claim.
- An energy_ranking claim needs at least MLIP relaxation evidence of kind energy_ranking or
  stability.
- When admissible records disagree, the claim is unresolved.
- Evidence that does not cover the claim's stated scope cannot support a decisive verdict.
- Answer unresolved when the evidence does not decide the claim, and request DFT only when a DFT
    calculation could decide it. Select a follow-up test only when it addresses a visible evidence
    gap, and only from the provided options.

Does the evidence support, contradict, or leave the claim unresolved?
